The spacebar is used to fire your laser. 
ESC can be pressed to QUIT at anytime. (does not exit game display)

Every enemy killed is worth 100 pts.
For every enemy killed the game difficulty increases slightly.
Starting game difficulty is 300 + 10 per enemy killed.

Final Project- Requirement 9: apply one Python concept we did not learn in Class:
sprites! This is quite a major concept, as it is used to group sprites into list, run through each sprite to test for collison, and .kill() those sprites if collisions occur.
